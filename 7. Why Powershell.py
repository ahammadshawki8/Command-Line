# Why should we use powershell instead of command prompt?

# PowerShell is  a more powerful command-line shell and scripting language than the Command Prompt. 
# PowerShell is more complicated than the traditional Command Prompt, but it’s also much more powerful.
# The Command Prompt is dramatically inferior to shells available for Linux and other Unix-like systems,
# but PowerShell competes favorably.
# In addition, most Command Prompt commands are usable in PowerShell, whether natively or through aliases.
# no only that we can also use many functionality of linux based shells in powershell.
# and powershell has lots and lots of functionality compared to a command prompt.


# how powershell differs from command prompt?

# PowerShell is actually very different from the Command Prompt.
# It uses different commands, known as cmdlets in PowerShell. 
# Many system administration tasks — from managing the registry to WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) — are exposed via PowerShell cmdlets,
# while they aren’t accessible from the Command Prompt.

# PowerShell makes use of pipes—just as Linux does—
# that allow you to pass the output of one cmdlet to the input of another cmdlet.
# Thus, you can use multiple cmdlets in sequence to manipulate the same data. 
# Unlike Unix-like systems—which can only pipe streams of characters (text)—PowerShell pipes objects between cmdlets. 
# And pretty much everything in PowerShell is an object, including every response you get from a cmdlet. 
# This allows PowerShell to share more complex data between cmdlets, operating more like a programming language.

# we can see windows tells us that cmd performs text-based command line functions.
# whereas powershell performs object-based command line functions.

# PowerShell isn’t just a shell.
# It’s a powerful scripting environment we can use to create complex scripts for managing Windows systems much more easily
# than we could with the Command Prompt.

# The Command Prompt is essentially just a legacy environment carried forward in Windows—an environment that copies all of the various DOS commands we would find on a DOS system.
# It is painfully limited, can’t access many Windows system administration features, is more difficult to compose complex scripts with, and so on.
# PowerShell is a new environment for Windows system administrators that allows them to use a more modern command-line environment to manage Windows.

# So, in conclusion we should definately uslearn and use powershell.
