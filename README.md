# Command-Line
The command line is a text interface for your computer. It's a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer's operating system to run. From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac OS.
It is very important to get femiliar with command line code as programmers have to use them frequently. There is hardly any project without little bit of command line code.
In this repository, I have discussed how to code in CMD and powershell and also discussed about sys and os standerd module of python. Coders will find some files about virtual environment (venv, virtualenv, pipenv) and a brief overview of how to use pip (package management of python).
